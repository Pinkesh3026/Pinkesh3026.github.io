## About My Photography

Photography has been my creative outlet alongside scientific research. I find inspiration in the intersection between art and science, often capturing the aesthetic beauty found in laboratory settings, microscopic worlds, and the natural environments that inspire my research.

My photographic interests include:
- **Scientific Photography**: Laboratory aesthetics, microscopy, and equipment
- **Nature & Landscape**: Edinburgh's stunning scenery and beyond
- **Urban Architecture**: Modern and historic buildings
- **Abstract & Macro**: Close-up details and artistic compositions
