## Biography

I am a biotechnologist with specialized expertise in **nanotechnology**, **drug delivery systems**, and **therapeutic protein research**. Currently based in Edinburgh, UK, I have a proven track record in R&D environments with hands-on experience in bioreactor operations, analytical biochemistry, and laboratory workflows.

My research focuses on developing innovative **nanotherapeutic carriers** and optimizing **bioprocess systems** for enhanced drug delivery applications. I am particularly interested in the intersection of nanotechnology and biotechnology, where I work on creating novel solutions for improving therapeutic protein bioavailability.

## Beyond Research

When I'm not in the laboratory, you'll find me behind a camera lens. **Photography** is my creative outlet, allowing me to capture the beauty of science, nature, and urban landscapes. This artistic perspective often influences my approach to scientific visualization and presentation.
